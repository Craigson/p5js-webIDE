This project adapts the [p5.js Desktop IDE](https://github.com/processing/p5.js-editor) (originally by Sam Lavigne, GSOC '14) for the web, with inspiration from [Gene Kogan's p5 Sandbox](https://github.com/genekogan/p5js-sandbox) and many other projects. Thank you to everyone who has contributed so far. Check out the [Web IDE Brainstorm on Hackpad](https://p5jscon.hackpad.com/Web-IDE-Brainstorm-d74TxVTnU4H) and feel free to join in on this open source project.

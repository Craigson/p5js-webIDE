## About
A Web IDE for p5.js. This project adapts the [p5.js Desktop IDE](https://github.com/processing/p5.js-editor) (originally by Sam Lavigne, GSOC '14) for the web, with inspiration from [Gene Kogan's p5 Sandbox](https://github.com/genekogan/p5js-sandbox) and many other projects. The goal is to make it easy to create, browse, share, and remix creative code sketches directly from the browser. Create an account and start sketching!

## Contributors
